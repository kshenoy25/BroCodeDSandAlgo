    // Graph = non-linear aggregation of nodes and edges

    // edge = connection between two-nodes
    // two nodes connected = adjacency
    // directed and un-directed graph

    // undirected graph = FaceBook/ social network application with adjacency between "friends" or nodes
    //                    Model for networks
    // directed graph = contains edges that link one node pointing to another(vice versa). Other words - one way connections
    // example such as a map of a city and its possible destinations/ routes

    // two ways to represent a graph:
    //           - Adjacency matrix | runtime complexity = O(1) spacetime complexity = O(V^2)/ uses more space : v = number of vertices

    //           - Adjacency list | each element is a separate LinkedList | runtime complexity = O(V ~ O(n)  space complexity = O(V + E)/ uses less space
